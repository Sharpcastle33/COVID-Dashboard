# COVID-Dashboard
 
For this project I led a team of students to create a webapp while learning about new technologies and the SDLC. We pitched the app, wrote user stories, built the backend Django server, and integrated it with a quick-n-dirty React server to demo the features. The app features real data from the CDCâ€™s API servers, OAuth2 support, a decoupled two-tier architecture, and a SQLite DB for storing user information/bookmarks.

I was personally responsible for our REST API and OAuth2 integration, and later on, the interactive map.
